# Carcassonne
This project was designed by Abi, Grace, Jack, and James as a spin off the board game Carcassonne. 

The goal of Carcassonne is to score the most points by creating completed cities, roads, monasteries with tiles and meeples (player pieces). Points are awarded throughout the game and at the end based on the size and completion of each feature. This game can be played 1-4 human players. At all times there will be 4 total players, supplemental players will be assigned to AI.
