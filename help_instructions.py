''' NOTE for future functionality/ better error handling:
    Maybe create input error handing incase a player tries 
    to place a tile where it shouldn't be -- have an error message
    pop-up for each rule that is broken.
    Ex. if a player tries to place a road tile from a castle,
    an error message will pop-up when the road tile overlaps the 
    castle tile, and will give a specific warning (alg. will determine
    that the road tile cannot connect with the castle tile)
