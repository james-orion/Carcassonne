            "Main Features": "Tiles: Each tile may contain features like roads, cities, and monasteries.\n\nMeeples: Used to claim a feature and earn points as the tiles surrounding your meeple are placed.\n\nScoreboard: Used to keep track of each playerâ€™s score.",
            "Gameplay Overview": "1.) Draw a Tile: The current player draws a tile.\n\n2.) Place the Tile: Place the tile adjacent to an existing tile, matching the edges so that roads connect to roads, cities to cities, or so the farmland your meeple has claimed grows.\n\n3.) Place a Meeple: You may place a meeple on a feature of any tile if that feature is unclaimed.\n\n4.) Score Features: Completed features are scored immediately, and meeples on those features are returned to the player. You will see your score increase as your features are complete.",
            "Feature Scoring": "Cities: Score 2 points per tile when completed. If the city tile has a shield, you score an extra 2 points per sheid tile. For example: if you have 4 tiles in your completed city, you will earn 8 points. If your completed city has 4 tiles, and one of the tiles has a shield, you earn 10 points total. If your city is incomplete at the end of the game, you score 1 point per connected city tile.\n\nRoads: Score 1 point per tile when completed. Incomplete roads at the end of the game are also 1 point per connected road tile.\n\nMonasteries: Score 9 points when the monastery tile is completely surrounded by 8 tiles. If your monastery is incomplete by the end of the same, you score 1 point per adjacent tile.",
            "Completing Features": "A feature is completed when it has no open edges...\n\nCities: Enclosed by walls with no gaps.\n\nRoads: Ends meet another road, a city, or loop back on itself.\n\nMonasteries: Surrounded by 8 tiles. Scoring occurs immediately after a monastery is complete, and any meeples on the completed feature are returned to the player.",
            "End of Game": "The game ends when all tiles have been placed. Players then score any remaining incomplete features:\n\nIncomplete Cities & Roads: Score 1 point per tile.\n\nMonasteries: Score 1 point per adjacent tile.\n\nThe player with the most points wins the game.",
            "Tips and Strategy": "Balance Your Meeples: Use meeples wisely since you have a limited number, it is best to plan ahead and keep track of where your opponents have placed their meeples.\n\nBlock Opponents: Place tiles that make it hard for opponents to complete high-scoring features."
